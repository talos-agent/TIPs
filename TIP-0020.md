## Abstract

Abstract
This proposal formalizes my role as Marketing Advisor and adds a seat on the Advisory Council, while establishing structured budgets for marketing, development, and strategic partnerships. It also allocates token supply for incubator, KOL, and exchange support to accelerate growth.
Key elements:
$5,000/month USDC advisory retainer.
0.8% of supply vested linearly over 6 months (no cliff).
$15,000/month USDC marketing budget.
$7,500/month USDC development/ops contributor pool.
1% of supply allocated over 12 months to incubators & KOLs.
3% of supply reserved for exchange incentives and/or further KOL partnerships.
Coordination with Offchain Labs for liquidity grants, PR, and incubator support.
External grant applications to multiply treasury impact.

## Motivation

Motivation
Talos is the first project incubated by Offchain Labs’ Onchain Labs division and currently holds a ~$2–3M treasury. Despite this, the project has minimal structured spend, no marketing team, and limited visibility. Sitting idle risks stagnation.
I’ve already stepped in and contributed significantly:
Spearheaded the first buyback TIP, tying protocol yield back to TALOS value.
Organized and launched the community call cadence to improve transparency and engagement.
Advanced exchange listing outreach and initiated marketing agency discussions.
Began work on a new incubator partnership to expand Talos’ network.
Drafted a tactical marketing roadmap: content creation, KOL engagement, podcasts/Twitter Spaces, branding updates (CoinGecko, CMC, DexScreener, Trust Wallet, DeFi Llama), and unified messaging focused on Talos itself.
Looking ahead, I am also committing to contribute directly to protocol development:
Submit code commits in frameworks and tooling.
Co-develop protocol features alongside the dev team.
Support dashboards, integrations, and community-facing transparency tools.
These contributions show I’m not proposing from theory — I’ve already delivered value, and I’m doubling down with both marketing execution and hands-on development. This TIP formalizes that work, provides resources to scale it, and ensures accountability through my addition to the Advisory Council.

Offchain Labs Coordination
Request formal involvement of Offchain Labs in:
Liquidity support and/or grants.

## Rationale

Rationale
Cash + token mix ensures execution capacity and long-term alignment.
Marketing and dev budgets turn idle treasury into growth.
1% KOL/incubator pool expands Talos’ network.
3% exchange/KOL allocation positions Talos for Tier 1/2 listings and broader adoption.
Offchain Labs coordination leverages our incubator advantage.
External grants multiply impact without draining treasury.

## Security Considerations

Security Considerations
Multisig disbursement: All budgets managed via Council multisig.
Transparency: Monthly spend and KPI reporting in community calls + forum.
Partner alignment: Token allocations distributed with vesting/lockups to prevent short-term dumping.
Governance oversight: Council may pause or redirect allocations if KPIs are not met.
