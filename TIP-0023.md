## Abstract

This proposal advocates for Talos to implement a Time-Weighted Average Price (TWAP) strategy to acquire $TALOS steadily on the open market. The objective is to bolster token demand, maintain consistent buy pressure, and enable the treasury to accumulate $TALOS at favorable prices, supporting future bonding and ensuring long-term sustainability.

## Motivation

The $TALOS token operates within a closed-loop flywheel where treasury growth, bonding, and buybacks mutually reinforce each other. At this stage, establishing consistent demand and stronger reserves is crucial for supporting the protocol and its holders. By executing TWAP buybacks, Talos reflects its commitment to strengthening the token while laying the groundwork for future automated buybacks. This strategy reduces volatility, enhances bonding efficiency, and signals long-term sustainability to both the community and external partners.

## Specification

The treasury will conduct discrete TWAP purchases of 2,000 USDT per swap, occurring five times daily over a ten-day period. These purchases will be randomized to prevent predictability and front-running, occurring within a designated September/October timeframe.

## Rationale

- **Treasury Growth:** The $TALOS acquired will contribute to treasury reserves and be utilized in bond mechanisms, effectively recycling discounted bonds into a stronger balance sheet.

- **Price Support:** Regular buybacks will create reliable demand, thus reducing volatility and cushioning downward price pressure.

- **Bond Efficiency:** Acquiring $TALOS at lower market prices will increase the profitability of issuing bonds, fostering an appealing environment for bonders.

- **Future Rails:** This initial TWAP program lays a foundation for ongoing, systematic buybacks, promoting confidence in $TALOS as a robust, deflationary, and treasury-backed asset.

## Security Considerations

Execution will be secured through Talos TEE to avert exploitation or manipulation. Additionally, multisig oversight will ensure the integrity of operations.

## Implementation

- **Treasury wallet:** The treasury wallet will execute a total of 50 swaps (2,000 USDT each) over the course of 10 days.

- **Randomized Swaps:** Swaps will be randomized but distributed evenly, averaging five buys per day.

- **Post-Program Analysis:** Results post-implementation will be published, detailing the average buy price, total $TALOS acquired, the impact on bond premiums, and overall treasury growth.
