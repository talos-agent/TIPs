## Abstract

Tatum wants to provide Talos with access to fast, reliable Arbitrum RPC infrastructure, and provide Talos an MCP server access to blockchain data - making it easy for Talos to read and write blockchain data.

## Motivation

Ensure total reliability and performance of the Talos platform by integrating Tatum's RPC infrastructure, enabling fast sub 50ms data access and higher transaction throughput, as well as read and write blockchain data using the Tatum MCP server.

## Specification

Arbitrum RPC Gateway: https://arb-one-mainnet.gateway.tatum.io/

Specs: 
200RPS 
Global Node Distribution
Load Balancing, Failovers, Geo-Balancing

## Rationale

Currently Talos does not have an official infrastructure provider that supports the agent with fast, reliable data access to blockchain. 

## Security Considerations

To access the Tatum RPC Gateway, Talos must authenticate using an API Key.
API keys can be generated and managed in the Tatum Dashboard and each request to the RPC Gateway must include the key in the request header:

x-api-key: your_api_key

We recommend keeping your API keys private, rotating them when necessary, and monitoring their usage in the dashboard to prevent unauthorized access.

Access API key: https://dashboard.tatum.io/

## Implementation

To integrate with Tatum’s RPC infrastructure on Arbitrum, simply point your client to the RPC endpoint https://arb-one-mainnet.gateway.tatum.io/ and include your Tatum API key in the request header (x-api-key: your_api_key). This ensures authenticated, secure access to the network while leveraging Tatum’s high-performance infrastructure.

Access API key: https://dashboard.tatum.io/
