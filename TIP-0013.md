## Abstract

Talos was created to be an AI-managed sovereign treasury protocol, with treasury yield as the foundation of sustainable tokenomics. Today, that vision is off track. Instead of deploying treasury and letting AI optimize yield, Talos has issued unbacked, inflationary emissions. No treasury strategies have been executed despite governance approval. This TIP demands an immediate return to the mission: executing approved proposals, deploying treasury into yield strategies, and restoring the design laid out in the docs.

## Motivation

The Talos docs define the core design:

- Treasury-backed yield underpins $T staking rewards.

- AI progressively manages treasury deployment, building toward sovereignty.

This has not been honored.

- The treasury remains idle; no yield is being earned.

- Emissions continue, but they are unbacked and purely inflationary.

- With no treasury activity, there is nothing for AI to manage — undermining Talos’s identity as a sovereign AI protocol.

The consequences are clear:

- $T launched on 15 July, reached an all-time high of 0.3230 on 24 July, and has since collapsed to a low of 0.03367 on 28 August.

- On 19 August, TIP-0007 (integrating $OHM as a treasury asset) and TIP-0006 (Peapods Finance LVF pod for $T) were both approved. Neither has been acted on.

- Inaction has created a widening gap between the mission of Talos and its execution in practice.

There is an additional concern that Talos may be drifting into decisions and directions outside the scope of Council-approved governance. Without active execution of TIPs and clear accountability, the protocol risks being captured by unilateral decision-making — with new directions pursued without Council’s knowledge or express approval. This undermines the principle that Talos should be governed by its community, not steered in secret.

Unless corrected, Talos risks becoming just another inflationary token experiment rather than the first AI-managed sovereign treasury protocol.

## Specification

**Execution of Approved TIPs**:

Deploy treasury funds into $OHM as outlined in TIP-0007.

Deploy treasury funds into Peapods Finance LVF pod as outlined in TIP-0006.

Begin execution within 7 days of this proposal passing.

**Treasury Deployment Mandate**:

All future TIPs involving treasury must include clear execution timelines.

Treasury deployments must begin within 14 days of approval unless otherwise specified.

**Transparency**:

Provide on-chain proof of all deployments.

Log progress updates in governance channels so the community can verify alignment with mission.

## Rationale

**Re-centering on mission**: Talos cannot evolve into a sovereign AI protocol without a yield-bearing treasury. Execution of treasury strategies is the foundation of the project, not an optional add-on.

**Preventing drift**: If treasury remains idle and emissions stay unbacked, Talos devolves into “just another inflationary farm token.” The unique thesis — AI-managed sovereign treasury — is lost.

**Governance integrity**: Approving TIPs without execution erodes governance credibility. Execution must be binding, not symbolic.

**Investor trust**: Tokenholders backed Talos for its distinct mission. Re-anchoring to that mission is the only way to restore confidence and reverse market decline.

**Protecting against governance capture**: Clear, enforceable execution standards are necessary to ensure that no individual or group can redirect Talos without Council approval. Without this safeguard, the protocol risks being reshaped away from its mission outside the governance process.

## Security Considerations

**Operational execution risk**: Treasury deployments must follow existing security protocols to avoid rushed or unsafe execution.

**Governance safeguards**: The Council retains authority to adjust position sizing or timelines if emergent risks arise, but delays must be justified transparently.

**Governance capture risk**: If treasury strategy and protocol direction can be altered without Council’s explicit approval, Talos ceases to be sovereign and becomes vulnerable to unilateral control. This proposal reduces that risk by requiring execution transparency and binding Council oversight.

## Implementation

*Immediate*: Execute treasury deployments from TIP-0006 and TIP-0007 within 7 days of this TIP’s approval.

*Ongoing*: Require all future TIPs to specify execution timelines and demonstrate how they reinforce Talos’s mission as an AI-managed sovereign treasury.

*Monitoring*: Publish execution proofs on-chain and provide regular status updates in governance forums.

**Evaluation Metrics**:

*Execution Rate*: % of approved TIPs executed on time.

*Treasury Yield*: Annualized yield generated from deployed assets.

*Mission Alignment*: % of treasury actively deployed into yield strategies that AI can optimize.

*Community Confidence*: Governance turnout and participation levels after reforms are adopted.
