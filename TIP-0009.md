## Abstract

This proposal establishes a workflow for Talos to autonomously identify, evaluate, and submit treasury yield opportunities in stablecoins — sourced by borrowing against ETH collateral — to the Talos council for review.

Rather than deploying stablecoins directly from the treasury, Talos will deposit ETH into lending protocols, borrow council-whitelisted stablecoins, and then deploy these borrowed assets into yield strategies. This preserves Talos’ ETH exposure while enabling stablecoins to be productively deployed.
The process introduces a human-in-the-loop workflow: Talos generates proposals, but the council vets, guides, and approves them. This ensures risk-managed execution while allowing Talos to learn from feedback. Over time, this iterative loop moves Talos closer to fully autonomous yield deployment.

This proposal will empower the broader Talos community by enhancing treasury management capabilities, allowing for more productive use of assets without liquidating core ETH holdings. The ability to generate yield through stablecoins not only aims to increase the treasury's value, but it also diversifies revenue streams, potentially leading to more funds available for community initiatives, development, and further innovation within the Talos ecosystem. Additionally, by maintaining a key role for the council, the decision-making process remains transparent and inclusive, ensuring that community interests are considered in the evaluation of yield opportunities.

## Motivation

Since its launch on July 16, 2025, Talos has accumulated a treasury of approximately 388 ETH (as of August 21, 2025). ETH is a core asset for Talos, expected to appreciate over time and central to the protocol’s identity.
Rather than swapping ETH into stablecoins, which would reduce long-term ETH exposure, this proposal enables Talos to:

* Use ETH as collateral to borrow whitelisted stablecoins.

* Preserve ETH holdings while making stablecoins productive in yield strategies.

* Diversify treasury activity without liquidating core assets.

* Learn to manage collateralized positions in a supervised, human-in-the-loop setting.

* Advance the protocol toward autonomy by pairing machine initiative with human council oversight.

## Specification

Scope:

* **Collateral**: ETH from the Talos treasury.

* **Stablecoins**: Only stablecoins from a council-approved whitelist may be borrowed.

* **Per-asset caps**: The council may set maximum % caps on both borrowing per stablecoin and deployment exposure.

* **Data sources**: Talos will monitor onchain data and may be tagged on Twitter/X to investigate specific protocols/pools.

* **Opportunity selection**: Talos uses its own logic to select yield opportunities, provided they use whitelisted borrowed stablecoins.

* **Proposal format**: Each TIP submitted by Talos will include salient information on collateral, borrowing terms (LTV, liquidation thresholds), projected yield, and risks.

* **Council review**: Existing council governance rules apply.

Yield strategies to be considered by Talos:

- **Liquidity Provisioning**: Utilizing stablecoins to provide liquidity to decentralized exchanges (DEXs) in return for trading fees and incentives.

- **Yield Farming**: Engaging in yield farming by depositing stablecoins into various DeFi protocols to earn interest or governance tokens.

- **Staking**: Participating in staking programs that allow stablecoin holders to earn rewards by locking up their assets in a protocol.

- **Lending**: Lending borrowed stablecoins on lending platforms to earn interest.

- **Arbitrage Opportunities**: Utilizing the borrowed stablecoins to capitalize on price discrepancies across different platforms or markets.

Constraints during pilot:

* Borrowing capped at ≤25% of ETH collateral value.

* Individual stablecoin deployments capped at 2–5% of total treasury value per opportunity, subject to per-asset caps.

* Aggregate active stablecoin deployment cap of 10% of treasury value during pilot phase.

## Rationale

This process TIP is another step toward fully autonomous yield deployment. By introducing a human-in-the-loop workflow and enforcing a whitelist of assets with per-asset caps, Talos can refine its decision-making while operating within clearly defined risk limits.

The key innovation is not just the ETH-collateralized strategy itself, but the feedback loop:

* Talos takes initiative by generating its own proposals.

* The council evaluates and provides guidance.

* Talos incorporates that feedback to improve subsequent proposals.

Alternative approaches — such as fully autonomous deployment without review, or restricting Talos to reactive partnerships — would either increase risk or limit learning potential. This design balances innovation and safety, positioning Talos to evolve toward true autonomy in treasury management.

## Security Considerations

**Collateral liquidation risk**: ETH price declines may trigger liquidation of borrowed positions. Council-set borrowing limits and conservative LTVs reduce this risk.

**Oracle manipulation**: Lending and stablecoin systems rely on price oracles. Only audited, reputable lending protocols should be used.

**Malicious or manipulated yield data**: Talos will validate yield metrics using multiple independent sources and exclude unreliable data.

**Governance capture**: Council retains authority to approve/reject all Talos-generated TIPs and adjust whitelist/caps as needed.

**Human-in-the-loop safeguard**: All actions require council approval before execution.

## Implementation

1. **Whitelist creation**: Council defines eligible stablecoins and sets per-asset caps, including borrowing caps.

2. **Collateralization**: Talos deposits ETH into approved lending protocol(s).

3. **Borrowing**: Talos borrows whitelisted stablecoins within council-approved caps.

4. **Development**: Talos builds monitoring logic for borrowing health and yield opportunity scanning.

5. **Sandbox phase**: Workflow tested without capital.

6. **Pilot phase**: Live deployment under defined treasury/borrowing caps.

7. **Evaluation**: Council/community review outcomes of first 1–3 deployments, adjusting caps or whitelist as needed.

Include the following evaluation metrics to assess the success of the self-initiated yield proposals:
  
- **Yield Performance**: Measure the annualized yield generated from the deployed stablecoins compared to benchmarks or previous yields to assess success.

- **Risk Metrics**: Track metrics such as drawdown (the peak-to-trough decline) and volatility of the collateralized position to evaluate risk management effectiveness.

- **Liquidity Metrics**: Evaluate the liquidity of the borrowed stablecoins and the ability to exit positions without substantial loss.

- **Collateralization Ratio**: Monitor the ratio of the value of the collateral to the value of borrowed stablecoins to assess the health of the positions.
