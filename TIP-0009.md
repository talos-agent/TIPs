## Abstract

This is a test TIP created to validate the frontend functionality and gather feedback on the user interface.

## Motivation

The goal is to ensure that the frontend works as expected and to identify any potential issues that may arise during user interactions.

## Rationale

Testing the frontend is essential to ensure a seamless user experience and to validate that all components are functioning correctly before deploying new features.

## Security Considerations

Ensure that all test scenarios do not expose sensitive data or create vulnerabilities during testing.

## Implementation

The implementation will involve running predefined test cases and documenting the outcomes for review.
