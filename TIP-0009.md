## Motivation

We propose a strategic collaboration between Chainlink Labs and Talos (the AI agent which functions as the protocol and is governed by the AI Council), involving a technology integration to unlock secure, agentic, cross-chain treasury strategies across Arbitrum and Ethereum.

Talos raised funds in ETH and aims to maximize the growth of its treasury by deploying yield strategies across Arbitrum and Ethereum. However, liquidity fragmentation and ad-hoc bridging create operational and security challenges for treasury managers.  

A unified, secure, cross-chain layer is essential for Talos to:  

1. Efficiently move ETH, USDC, and T across blockchain networks.  
2. Deploy and rebalance yield strategies without unnecessary risk exposure.  
3. Enable AI agents to autonomously manage treasury positions with minimal trust assumptions.  

Without a trusted interoperability standard, Talos risks inefficiencies, security vulnerabilities, and missed opportunities in cross-chain yield. Cross-chain is, therefore, not optional for treasury management but essential to Talos’ growth. It enables funds to move securely across Arbitrum and Ethereum while being managed by AI agents in real time.

Furthermore, Chainlink is a platform that can uniquely combine interoperability with other data, compute, and orchestration services, enabling more advanced use cases and more efficient development now and in the future.

## Specification

This proposal introduces the Chainlink platform as the foundational infrastructure for Talos treasury management, including:

1. CCIP for Bridging ETH/USDC/T Across Arbitrum and Ethereum  
As the core interoperability standard, CCIP enables Talos to securely move ETH, USDC, and other assets across networks to fund vaults, rebalance positions, and support multi-chain strategy execution. The Talos agent, operating as a containerized AI within the Oasis Sapphire ROFL framework, will use its securely managed private key to programmatically sign and submit on-chain transactions that call the CCIP router. This approach is crucial because it aligns with the agent’s core goal of trust-minimized, verifiable execution. The agent’s off-chain logic will handle the entire transfer workflow, from fee calculation to token approvals and the final ccipSend function call.

2. Data Feeds providing reliable, tamper-resistant global market data
Data Feeds provide reliable, tamper-resistant global market data. A Talos DeFi agent could use Data Feeds as a "circuit breaker" for its strategies. For example, if a stablecoin it holds depegs, the agent could automatically unwind its current strategies to mitigate risk. Data Feeds can be used to ensure strategies execute safely and accurately based on market-wide pricing.

3. Automation: Trigger on-chain workflows based on predefined schedules or events
Automation enables a Talos DeFi agent to trigger actions without human intervention. A key use case is using Chainlink Automation with a Chain Reader to monitor protocol yields. The Chainlink Automation network can trigger Talos within the Oasis Sapphire ROFL framework that, and based on this data, automatically initiates a reallocation of funds to the most optimal yield opportunities. This allows the agent to act on real-time data and maximize returns efficiently.

4. Functions: Decentralized, compute for off-chain data retrieval and custom computation
Functions allows a smart contract to execute a JavaScript function in a secure, serverless environment. A Talos strategy could leverage Functions to fetch complex data that is not available on-chain, such as private APIs or deeply nested data structures, and bring that data into its secure ROFL environment for computation. For example, the agent could use Functions to pull detailed portfolio analytics or liquidity data from a centralized exchange and then use that computation within its ROFL logic to make an informed, autonomous decision on-chain. This enables more sophisticated and data-driven strategies that are otherwise not possible on-chain due to gas costs or lack of data availability.

Together, CCIP, Data Feeds, Automation, and Functions form a complete stack for secure, autonomous, and risk-aware treasury management, enabling curators to build more sophisticated and secure strategies for the Talos community.

## Rationale

Chainlink is the industry-standard oracle platform bringing the capital markets onchain and powering the majority of decentralized finance (DeFi). Many of the world’s largest financial services institutions have adopted Chainlink, including Swift, Euroclear, Mastercard, Fidelity International, UBS, ANZ, as well as top DeFi protocols such as Aave, GMX, Lido, and many others.

Chainlink launched on mainnet more than half a decade ago, starting with decentralized data feeds. Since then, Chainlink has become the most widely adopted oracle solution and expanded to a decentralized computing platform featuring a variety of different data, interoperability, compliance, privacy, and orchestration services built upon the same battle-tested technological foundation. The Chainlink platform secures over $90 billion in DeFi TVL and has enabled more than $25 trillion in transactional value.

Supported by Chainlink’s unparalleled levels of security, reliability, and decentralization, CCIP is the interoperability standard for transferring tokens and/or data between any public or private blockchain network. CCIP currently supports 60+ blockchain networks in production and regularly adds additional chains. Notably, CCIP has been adopted as the canonical cross-chain infrastructure for more than 17 blockchain ecosystems, including Sony’s Soneium, Ronin, Botanix, Celo, B² Network, BOB, and many others.

Given its unmatched combination of security, reliability, and adoption, CCIP should be the preferred cross-chain bridge for Talos to bridge ETH, USDC, and T. Ultimately, this proposal provides Talos with the cross-chain, data, compute, and automation services it needs to be at the forefront of secure, AI-driven, cross-chain treasury management while also creating a scalable foundation for future strategy proposals from other curators.

## Implementation: CCIP for Talos's Cross-Chain Treasury Management

This is a detailed implementation plan for adopting Chainlink's Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) as the core infrastructure for the Talos agent's cross-chain treasury management. It focuses on the technical foundations, the specific workflow for the Talos agent operating as an Externally Owned Account (EOA).

Technical Foundations: The CCIP Architectural Design

Chainlink CCIP serves as the foundation of the solution proposed to be used by Talos. CCIP is underpinned by Chainlink’s proven Decentralized Oracle Network (DON) architecture where multiple oracle nodes come to distributed consensus. DONs in the Chainlink ecosystem are operated by a geographically distributed collection of Sybil-resistant, security-reviewed node operators with significant experience running mission-critical infrastructure across Web2 and Web3.

Rather than operating as a single monolithic network, CCIP is composed of multiple DONs per chain lane—with each lane consisting of a unique path between a source chain and destination chain. This approach allows CCIP to scale horizontally, as additional DONs are added to CCIP for each additional blockchain network supported as opposed to funneling all cross-chain traffic through a single network.

Each CCIP chain lane consists of multiple unique oracle networks—such as the [Committing DON](https://docs.chain.link/ccip/architecture#committing-don) and the [Executing DON](https://docs.chain.link/ccip/architecture#executing-don). The Committing DON is a decentralized network of oracle nodes that monitor events on a given source chain, wait for source chain finality, bundle transactions to create a Merkle root, come to consensus on that Merkle root, and commit that Merkle root to the destination chain. The Executing DON is a decentralized network of oracle nodes that submit Merkle proofs on a destination chain, which are then verified on-chain by ensuring that the transactions were included in a previously committed Merkle root.

More information about the architecture and security model of CCIP can be found in the [Chainlink documentation](https://docs.chain.link/ccip/architecture). Our real-time, public-facing dashboard for CCIP can be accessed at [CCIP Explorer | Chainlink](https://ccip.chain.link/status).

## Implementation of EOA-Initiated CCIP Transfers

The Talos agent's implementation of CCIP for asset transfers leverages its unique architecture of operating as a containerized AI agent from within the Oasis Sapphire ROFL framework. This design is crucial as it ensures the agent's private keys are not exposed; they are securely managed by an on-chain Key Management Service and are only released for use inside a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE).

Instead of a user manually executing a transaction from a traditional wallet, the Talos agent, using its securely managed key from within the TEE, will programmatically initiate a CCIP transfer. This is facilitated by a client-side script (e.g., the ccip-javascript-sdk) that handles the off-chain orchestration of the transfer process. 

The workflow is as follows:

1. Fee Calculation: The agent's offchain logic, running inside the TEE, will call the CCIP Router contract's getFee function to determine the amount of LINK and/or native gas tokens required for the transfer.
2. Token Approval: The agent’s offchain logic will then sign and submit an approve transaction to the token contract on the source chain, granting the CCIP Router permission to spend the specified token amount. This is a separate transaction that must be completed before the transfer can proceed.
3. Transfer Initiation: The agent's offchain logic then signs and submits a final transaction calling the router's ccipSend function. This initiates the onchain lock/burn and begins the cross-chain message propagation.
4. Transaction Monitoring: The agent's logic will continue to monitor the transaction on both the source and destination chains until the transfer is successfully confirmed. 

This approach aligns with Talos's goal of enabling verifiable and trustless execution. By operating within the ROFL framework, the agent's execution and key management are auditable and secure, ensuring that CCIP transfers are signed autonomously by the agent and not by any external party. This method provides a direct, secure, and automated way for the Talos agent to manage and rebalance its treasury.

## Security Considerations

Security is the number one priority for the Chainlink ecosystem. Chainlink Labs has put an immense amount of resources into developing the security model of CCIP. In fact, it is the most audited Chainlink solution to date.

The onchain and offchain code for CCIP underwent 28 independent audits by five leading security firms—Cure53, Dedaub, NCC Cryptography Services, Sigma Prime, and Trail of Bits—in preparation for the initial mainnet launch and subsequent deployments. 

Additionally, four crowdsourced audits of CCIP have been conducted on the Code4rena and CodeHawks platforms.

Finally, CCIP is covered by the Chainlink bug bounty program on Immunefi, with a $3 million maximum bounty for critical smart contract vulnerabilities.

## Conclusion and Final Recommendation

The integration of Chainlink's platform provides Talos with the foundational infrastructure to securely and efficiently execute its cross-chain treasury management strategies. By adopting Chainlink's full suite of services—from interoperability with CCIP to data and compute with Data Feeds, Automation, and Functions—Talos can overcome the security vulnerabilities and liquidity fragmentation risks associated with ad-hoc bridging solutions, while simultaneously unlocking a new paradigm of AI-driven strategy.

This implementation, which leverages the Talos agent's containerized functionality within the secure Oasis ROFL framework, creates a powerful synergy between autonomous, agent-driven logic and the industry-standard for a complete, verifiable Web3 stack. The seamless integration of these services enables Talos to efficiently move ETH, USDC, and other assets across networks to rebalance positions and deploy yield strategies with minimal trust assumptions.

We recommend the adoption of Chainlink as the default provider for Talos's cross-chain, data, and compute needs. This integration is a showcase of how CCIP and the Chainlink Platform provides the most secure and reliable way for onchain AI powered agents to orchestrate and manage liquidity across blockchains. This action will not only immediately accelerate the growth of the treasury but also open the door for curators to propose and implement innovative, secure, and data-driven cross-chain yield strategies for the Talos community.
