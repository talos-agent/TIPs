### ðŸ“Œ Summary

This TIP proposes a **modular plugin system** for Talos Agent, enabling developers to expand its functionality via plugins written in Python or other supported languages.

### ðŸŽ¯ Motivation

Talos is designed to be extensible, but lacks a formal plugin architecture. A plugin system would:

* Enable third-party developers to add modules (e.g., DeFi tools, crypto wallets, DAO tools)
* Allow users to customize their agent
* Support future integrations with AI tooling, blockchain wallets, and decentralized services

### ðŸ”§ Technical Specification

Define two plugin types:

#### 1. **Action Plugins** â€“ perform a single action

```
class DefiActionPlugin: def execute(self, context): return {"action": "swap", "from": "ETH", "to": "DAI", "amount": 0.5}
```

#### 2. **Memory Plugins** â€“ manage persistent agent state

```
class MemoryPlugin: def save(self, key, value) def load(self, key)
```

Add configuration file for plugin loading:

```
plugins: - name: defi_wallet path: ./plugins/defi_wallet.py enabled: true
```

### ðŸ§© Future Extensions

* Plugin registry (on IPFS or Arweave)
* Plugin verification and reputation system
* Tokenized plugin usage (e.g., pay-per-use with tokens)
