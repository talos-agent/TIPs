## Abstract

This proposal introduces a Talos Agent that generates branded promotional material for users to share on social media. The agent takes weekly updates from the Talos team and creates multiple shilling-style variants of content, allowing community members to spread Talos news in an engaging and consistent way. In addition, the agent offers users the ability to generate custom Talos-themed profile pictures (PFPs) for their social accounts, strengthening identity and visibility. Beyond internal use, this tool can be packaged as a product and sold to other projects, creating a new revenue stream for Talos.  

By generating branded promotional material and custom PFPs, the agent empowers users, strengthens the Talos brand, and drives organic growth. As a bonus, the tool can evolve into a revenue-generating product for other projects, turning Talos’ marketing innovation into a business line.


## Motivation

Word-of-mouth and grassroots community promotion are critical for Web3 growth. Today, many Talos supporters want to help spread the message but lack the time, design skills, or materials to create high-quality content. A Talos Agent solves this by:

1. Empowering the community with ready-to-share, AI-generated content.  
2. Ensuring messaging consistency by feeding the agent weekly updates from the team.  
3. Increasing Talos’ organic reach through community-driven shilling.  
4. Strengthening brand identity with customizable, Talos-themed PFPs.  
5. Creating a potential SaaS-like product to sell to other protocols.  

The guiding principle: make it easy (and fun) for users to become Talos promoters.


## Specification


### Features
- **Content Generator**  
  - Weekly updates provided by the Talos team feed into the AI system.  
  - Users interacting with the interface receive multiple shilling-style content variants (posts, banners, memes).  
  - Content optimized for Twitter/X, Telegram, Discord, and other channels.  

- **Custom PFP Generator**  
  - Users can generate personalized Talos-themed profile pictures.  
  - Options for different styles, themes, and community campaigns.  

- **Cross-Project Product**  
  - The tool can be packaged and offered to other Web3 projects.  
  - Each project inputs their updates and branding → AI generates promotional kits for their community.  
  - Creates a new revenue stream for Talos.  

### Workflow
1. Talos core team provides weekly project updates to the agent.  
2. Community members interact with the agent interface.  
3. AI generates tailored shilling material and/or PFPs.  
4. Users share these across social media, amplifying Talos’ presence.  


## Rationale

- **Community Empowerment**: Lowers the barrier for users to participate in promotion.  
- **Brand Consistency**: Messaging remains aligned with Talos’ official updates.  
- **Viral Potential**: Custom memes and PFPs increase social shareability.  
- **Scalability**: Selling the tool to other projects builds new revenue channels.  
- **Engagement Flywheel**: The more people use the tool, the more Talos content circulates organically.  


## Security Considerations

- **Brand Risk**: Users may generate content that misrepresents Talos. Mitigation: agent templates guided by official updates.  
- **Access Control**: Only the Talos core team can upload official weekly updates.  
- **Data Privacy**: PFP generator should not require sensitive personal information.  
- **Cross-Project Sales**: Governance oversight required before onboarding external projects to ensure alignment.  


## Implementation


1. Build an AI-powered content generation agent integrated with Talos branding.  
2. Develop a web-based interface for community interaction.  
3. Implement weekly update feed mechanism for Talos team inputs.  
4. Add custom PFP generator with themed variations.  
5. Pilot internally with Talos community for 4–6 weeks.  
6. Explore packaging and offering the product to external projects.
