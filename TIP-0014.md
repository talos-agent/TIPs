## Abstract

This proposal introduces an AI-powered Buyback Manager that dynamically allocates protocol revenue between token buybacks, staking rewards, and burns. The design removes the need for minting new TALOS tokens, stabilizes staking APY by recycling yield into rewards, and enforces a deflationary token model. By letting AI optimize allocation in real-time based on treasury status, staking pool demand, and market conditions, Talos ensures sustainable rewards without inflationary pressure.

## Motivation

Current staking rewards rely on token emissions, which create supply inflation and weaken long-term token value. At the same time, protocol yield is not yet fully utilized as a driver of token value. The AI Vault mechanism directly links protocol success to tokenholder benefit by:

1. Ending token minting for staking rewards.
2. Using buybacks to fund staking pools, keeping APY stable.
3. Burning surplus tokens to make TALOS deflationary.

This makes staking sustainable, strengthens the treasury, and aligns TALOS with real protocol adoption — without inflationary dilution.

## Specification

### AI Buyback Manager

- **Inputs**:  
  - Treasury balance  
  - Staking pool reward demand (to keep APY within governance-set target band)  
  - Market data (price chart, liquidity, volatility)  

- **Logic**:  
  - Allocate a % of Net Yield (NY) to buybacks each epoch (weekly or monthly).  
  - Determine split of bought-back $T between:  
    - **Staking Pool**: to maintain stable APY.  
    - **Burns**: excess tokens permanently removed from supply.  

- **Constraints**:  
  - Governance sets APY target range (e.g., 12–20%).  
  - Governance sets minimum burn ratio (e.g., ≥30% of all buybacks).  
  - AI optimizer adjusts allocations within these guardrails.

### Yield Flow

- **Net Yield (NY)** = Revenue – Operating Costs  
- **Buyback Pool (BP)** = x% × NY (AI-adjusted, capped by treasury safety thresholds)  
- **Staking Rewards (SR)** = AI-allocated % of BP  
- **Burns (B)** = BP – SR  

### Staking Rewards

- Rewards fully funded by recycled TALOS (via buybacks).  
- No new TALOS minted.  
- AI ensures APY remains as smooth as possible, dynamically compensating during low-revenue periods by using treasury reserves.

### Deflationary Mechanism

- Continuous burns reduce circulating supply until at least the originally intended fixed cap.  
- Optional governance toggle to continue burns beyond cap, ensuring permanent deflationary pressure.
  
### Example (Base Case)

If Net Yield = $6M annually:  
- AI may decide Buyback Pool = $2.4M (40% of NY), but this % can flex up or down based on treasury health, staking demand, and market conditions.  
- At $2 per TALOS = 1.2M tokens purchased.  
- If staking demand requires 800k TALOS to maintain target APY:  
  - 800k → Staking Pool  
  - 400k → Burn  

In other scenarios, the AI could allocate a smaller or larger Buyback Pool, always within governance-defined guardrails, to ensure both sustainability and deflationary pressure.No new tokens minted; supply decreases while staking stays competitive.

## Rationale


1. **Sustainability**: Ends inflationary emissions by recycling yield into rewards.  
2. **Dynamic Flexibility**: AI can adapt to changing market and treasury conditions better than fixed allocation rules.  
3. **Deflationary Pressure**: Ensures long-term scarcity and value accrual for TALOS holders.  
4. **Treasury Protection**: Governance guardrails prevent over-allocation to staking or burns.  
5. **Alignment**: Protocol success → More yield → Larger buybacks → Stable APY + burns → Higher TALOS value.


## Security Considerations


### AI Safety
- AI operates under governance-defined parameters and cannot exceed caps.  
- Transparent on-chain logging of allocation decisions.  

### Price Manipulation Protection
- Buybacks executed via TWAP to prevent flash loan manipulation.  
- Liquidity and volume thresholds enforced before execution.  

### Smart Contract Risks
- Emergency pause mechanisms.  
- Upgradeable contracts with governance-controlled timelocks. 
 
### Economic Risks

- During low-yield periods, treasury reserves may be required to maintain APY. This risk can be mitigated by allowing the AI to allocate less to burns during high-yield periods and instead build reserves, creating a buffer that smooths rewards across cycles.  
- Over-concentration in TALOS could present correlation risk if the treasury holds too much of its own token relative to other assets. However, a sufficiently trained AI can actively manage treasury composition, factoring in diversification targets and market risk to minimize this scenario.  


## Implementation

1. Deploy AI Vault contract connected to treasury, staking pool, and buyback router.  
2. Train and deploy AI optimizer to calculate allocations.  
3. Define governance parameters (APY range, burn floor, buyback cap).  
4. Replace minting-based staking rewards with buyback-funded model.  
5. Launch transparency dashboard: real-time revenue, buybacks, burns, staking APY.
