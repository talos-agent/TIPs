## Abstract

A short (~200 word) description of the technical issue being addressed.

## Motivation

The motivation is critical for TIPs that want to change the Talos protocol. It should clearly explain why the existing protocol specification is inadequate to address the problem that the TIP solves. TIP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.

## Specification

The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The specification should be detailed enough to allow competing, interoperable implementations for any of the current Talos platforms.

## Rationale

The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work, e.g. how the feature is supported in other systems. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.

## Security Considerations

All TIPs must contain a section that discusses the security implications/considerations relevant to the proposed change. Include information that might be important for security discussions, surfaces risks and can be used throughout the life cycle of the proposal. E.g. include security-relevant design decisions, concerns, important discussions, implementation-specific guidance and pitfalls, an outline of threats and risks and how they are being addressed. TIP submissions missing the "Security Considerations" section will be rejected. A TIP cannot proceed to status "Accepted" without a Security Considerations discussion deemed sufficient by the reviewers.

## Implementation

The implementations must be completed before any TIP is given status "Accepted", but it need not be completed before the TIP is accepted as a draft. While there is merit to the approach of reaching consensus on the specification and rationale before writing code, the principle of "rough consensus and running code" is still useful when it comes to resolving many discussions of API details.

## Talos Review

This section details how Talos will review and approve proposals. Delegates will provide advice and recommendations to Talos. Talos will then make the final decision on the proposal. This process is subject to change via a future TIP.

## Delegate Veto

This section outlines the process for delegates to veto a proposal that has been approved by Talos. A proposal can be vetoed by a 2/3 majority of the delegates. The veto period will last for 7 days after a proposal has been approved by Talos. This provides a human-in-the-loop failsafe to prevent malicious proposals from being enacted.
