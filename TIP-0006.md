## Abstract

This proposal specifies the creation of a **Peapods Finance Leveraged Volatility Farming (LVF) Pod** for the Talos AI native token ($T).

The proposed $T Pod will:  
1. Provide sustainable, non-dilutive yield to $T holders via volatility capture.  
2. Increase $T liquidity depth without fragmenting existing pools.  
3. Enable leveraged trading and lending markets for $T.  
4. Offer new treasury strategies for Talos AI, including yield farming, leveraged buybacks, and USDC lending.  
5. Enable leveraged exposure to $T by allowing users to borrow USDC against LP receipts and use it to acquire additional $T.

The $T Pod will issue **$pT** (podded $T) and **$pfUSDC-n** (pod USDC receipt) as liquid, yield-bearing ERC-20 derivatives, integrated into the Peapods protocol.

## Motivation

Talos AI currently offers ~11.6% APY via rebasing staking, with ~48% of supply staked, ~4–5% in liquidity pools, and ~40% idle in wallets and treasury.

A $T Pod can:  
- Capture yield for idle $T without emissions or dilution.  
- Monetize volatility while deepening $T liquidity.  
- Provide Pod users access to leveraged $T positions, collateralized by yielding LP receipts.  
- Enable Talos AI to strategically deploy idle treasury assets for buybacks, yield arbitrage, or lending.  
- Participation in the Pod can be considered equivalent to standard staking for governance purposes (once implemented), so it will not reduce Talos AI’s total governance voting power from staked tokens.

Given $T’s high historical volatility and relatively shallow liquidity (~6% liquidity/marketcap ratio), the Pod mechanism can smooth volatility impacts while enhancing yield opportunities for Talos AI and its community.

## Specification

**Pod Deployment**  
- Deploy via `PeapodsFactory` with pairing asset: $USDC.  
- Configure fees, oracle source, and liquidity parameters at launch.

**New Primitives**  
1. **$pT (Pod Token)** – ERC-20 derivative representing wrapped $T, up-only in $T terms due to fee capture/burn.  
2. **$pfUSDC-n (Pod USDC Receipt)** – ERC-4626 interest-bearing derivative of $USDC lent into the Pod market.

**User Flows**  
- **Bonding**: `bond(T)` → receive $pT.  
- **USDC Lending**: `deposit(USDC)` → receive $pfUSDC-n.  
- **Swapping**: $pT and $pfUSDC-n trade freely on integrated AMMs.  
- Users can borrow USDC against LP collateral and use it to purchase additional $T, creating leveraged $T exposure directly through the Pod.

**Yield Mechanics**  
- Pod fees are collected, converted into underlying, and burned from supply—raising the redemption value of $pT.  
- USDC lending yields interest per utilization and rate model.

## Rationale

Fee structure for high-volatility tokens like $T:  
- **Wrap Fee:** 1% – Encourages longer holding; cost to access leverage market.  
- **Unwrap Fee:** 5% (0% after 30-day cooldown) – Discourages rapid in/out yield arbitrage.  
- **Buy Fee:** 5% – Primarily captured from MEV/arbitrage; increases yield.  
- **Sell Fee:** 5% – Mirrors unwrap fee to prevent bypass.  
- **pTKN Burn:** 40% – High yield retention to compete with staking APY.

**Oracle Source:** Talos-controlled Camelot T/ETH pool (`0xd971ff5a7530919ae67e06695710b262a72e8f2f`) with sufficient depth and full-range liquidity to avoid out-of-range conditions.

**Design Considerations**:  
- LVF mechanics require LP receipts as collateral, inherently increasing liquidity depth before leverage is applied.  
- Treasury strategies (buybacks, yield arbitrage) can be executed atomically via Pod borrow facilities.

## Security Considerations

- **Code Security:** Peapods has been live for multiple years with 6+ audits. LVF implementation securing $60M+ TVL for ~6 months without incident.  
- **Oracle Dependence:** $T/$ETH liquidity must be maintained deep enough to secure pricing and liquidation safety.  
- **Leverage Risks:** While LVF pods generally stabilize volatility (collateralized by LP), excessive Pod TVL vs. base liquidity could raise liquidation risk. Talos should monitor ratios and issue public guidance if imbalances arise.  
- **Treasury Exposure:** Talos treasury assets deployed in Pod are subject to smart contract and market risks.

## Implementation

1. Talos deploys $T Pod via PeapodsFactory with specified parameters.  
2. Liquidity pairing with $USDC initialized; fees configured.  
3. Integrations with Talos AI frontends and treasury management systems.  
4. Post-launch monitoring of TVL, liquidity depth, and fee performance.

A reference implementation will use existing Peapods LVF contracts without modification beyond parameterization for $T.
