### Summary

This TIP proposes integrating **Parallax**, a decentralized inference protocol, into the Talos Agent to enable **distributed model execution** when local resources or models are insufficient.

### üéØ Motivation

Talos currently runs AI models locally, which guarantees **privacy and autonomy** but limits model size and performance. Integrating **Parallax** enables:

* Execution of models too large for local hardware
* On-demand compute from distributed providers
* Cryptographically verifiable execution
* Privacy-preserving usage of remote models
* Alignment with the **Gradient Network ecosystem**

### üîß Technical Specification

Add a `parallax_client` module and CLI flags to allow fallback to decentralized inference.

```
class ParallaxClient: def __init__(self, network="gradient-mainnet"): self.network = network def execute(self, model, prompt): # Send encrypted request over Parallax return decrypt_response(send_over_parallax(self.network, model, prompt))
```

#### CLI

```
# Local mode (default) talos run "Explain relativity" # Force Parallax mode talos run "Write an academic paper" --model=llama3-70b --parallax
```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Risks & Mitigations

|Risk|Mitigation|
| --- | --- |
|Latency|Cache frequent responses locally|
|Privacy|Encrypt prompts before sending|
|Model compatibility|Use registry from Parallax|
|Network downtime|Fallback to local mode|

### üß© Future Integration

* Add Lattica for peer-to-peer agent communication
* Support decentralized reputation and tasking systems
