# TIP-0008: Implement Flywheel Strategy Using DeFi Yield for TALOS Buybacks and Restaking

- Requires: None

## Summary

This proposal suggests allocating a portion of the staking treasury's DeFi yield to buy back $T tokens from the open market and restake them. This flywheel mechanism compounds protocol value by increasing treasury yield, reducing circulating supply, and reinforcing price â€” thereby growing the treasury in absolute dollar terms and expanding governance influence.

## Motivation

Talos has a fixed supply of 300 million $T, of which currently about 50% is staked and used in DeFi strategies by the protocol treasury. While this generates yield, that yield is underutilized from a strategic perspective. Redirecting part of it into $T buybacks and restaking:

- Creates steady buy pressure on $T, supporting long-term price appreciation.
- Increases the absolute USD value of treasury yield over time.
- Strengthens protocol governance through larger staked voting power.

This compounding effect ("flywheel") accelerates treasury growth and long-term protocol sustainability in both economic and governance terms.

## Specification

- **Initial Allocation:** 25% of net DeFi yield (after costs) to be used for $T buybacks.
- **Mechanism:**
  - At fixed intervals (e.g. monthly):
    - Calculate total yield in USD.
    - Deduct gas/operational costs.
    - Use 25% of net yield to buy $T on the open market.
    - Stake all purchased tokens via e.g. `StakeService`.

- **Rebalancing:** Remaining 75% of yield continues compounding or diversification.
- **Oversight:** Hypervisor ensures slippage control and timing optimization. Governance may adjust parameters.

## Treasury and Yield Projections

The Talos protocol has a fixed supply of **300 million $T**, of which currently about **50% is staked** and forms the treasury base (**150 million tokens**).

Based on varying token prices, the treasury valuation and (a conservative) yield potential scale as follows:

| TALOS Price | Staked Tokens | Treasury Value | 6% Yield | 25% Buyback Budget |
|-------------|----------------|----------------|----------|---------------------|
| $0.13       | 150M           | $19.5M         | $1.17M   | $292,500            |
| $0.50       | 150M           | $75.0M         | $4.5M    | $1,125,000          |
| $1.00       | 150M           | $150.0M        | $9.0M    | $2,250,000          |

This buyback mechanism is expected to support upward **price** pressure on $T, increasing both treasury valuation and the absolute DeFi yield it generates. Additionally, by accumulating more staked $T, the protocol strengthens its governance influence over future proposals and upgrades.

## Rationale

This strategy is conservative in allocation but powerful in effect. A 25% buyback budget balances treasury safety with strong price and governance reinforcement. It:

- Increases DeFi yield over time via price appreciation.
- Adds consistent buy-side liquidity to markets.
- Compounds staking power without inflation or dilution.

Compared to inflationary emissions or active asset trading, this mechanism is simpler, more predictable, and fully aligned with tokenholder interests.

## Backwards Compatibility

No compatibility issues. Buybacks and restaking are additive actions.

## Implementation

- A new service (e.g. `BuybackRestakeService`) will execute buybacks monthly.
- Source of funds: existing DeFi strategies.
- Buybacks routed through DEX aggregators (with slippage protection).
- The actual execution strategy of buybacks will be decided later, we strive for efficient orders preventing front running
- Purchased tokens automatically staked via e.g. `StakeService`.

## Security Considerations

- Buyback caps and rate limits to avoid manipulation.
- Hypervisor guards against economic inefficiency.
- Governance can pause, modify, or terminate the system via proposal.
