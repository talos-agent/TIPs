## Abstract

This proposal formalizes my role as Marketing & Technical Advisor and adds a seat on the Advisory Council. It introduces lean, token-aligned budgets to accelerate Talos’ growth and close the visibility gap with competitors, while ensuring no personal cash compensation.

Key points:

0.8% of TALOS supply vested over 6 months (no cliff).

$18,000/month USDC budget for external marketing agencies and/or developer grants/spend.

3% of supply reserved for KOL partnerships, liquidity, and exchange incentives.

Formal coordination with Offchain Labs for liquidity and PR.

Weekly council calls for strategy alignment and task coordination.

Pursuit of external grants to multiply resources.

## Motivation

Motivation

Talos has a strong treasury but limited structured spend. Without activation, growth risks stagnation.

Example: Sept 7–14, 2025 X socials — Talos’ top post reached 4.7k views, 110 likes, while Giza Tech’s launch-driven content hit 273k+ views and averaged 500+ likes, delivering 91x more impressions and 2x+ engagement. Talos is credible but quiet; competitors dominate attention.

To truly compete, Talos needs structured, accountable budgets and collaboration with both the council and Offchain Labs. This proposal is about giving the project the resources to match its technical strength with visibility and adoption.

## Specification
