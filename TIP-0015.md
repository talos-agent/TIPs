## Abstract

This proposal outlines the integration of risk details from Exponential Fi (https://exponential.fi/) into the Talos user interface, enabling Treasury Management strategies to utilize a consolidated credit risk rating system that enhances decision-making and risk assessment.

## Motivation

The integration of credit risk ratings from Exponential Fi will provide Talos users with a more comprehensive view of the risks associated with various investments as well as the blended risk exposure from a top-down level. By utilizing unified risk data, Talos can improve its Treasury Management strategies and optimize asset allocation based on informed risk assessments.

## Specification

The integration will involve extracting relevant risk data from the Exponential Fi API and displaying it within the Talos UI. The specific data points include credit ratings, risk scores, and any additional relevant metrics. The UI will update in real-time to reflect changes in risk assessments.

## Rationale

By integrating Exponential Fi's risk data, Talos can offer users a robust tool for assessing credit risk. This aligns with the platform's goal of promoting informed investment strategies by providing essential risk information at a glance.

## Security Considerations

Ensure that data handling adheres to best practices regarding API security, including authentication requirements for accessing Exponential Fi's data. Additionally, safeguard user data and privacy while displaying risk metrics. Also, disclaimers required to ensure that users are aware that credit risk ratings are indicative only and they should conduct their on due diligence to ensure this strategy suits their own objectives.

## Implementation

The implementation stage will require collaboration with the development team to integrate the Exponential Fi API, create the necessary UI components, and perform testing to ensure accurate data display and functionality. A timeline for completion will be established, along with necessary resources.
