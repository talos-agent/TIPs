## Abstract

This proposal recommends hiring a professional marketing agency to accelerate Talos’ adoption and visibility in the competitive AI + DeFi landscape. By delegating marketing to experienced specialists, Talos developers can focus entirely on innovation and security while ensuring the protocol maintains a consistent and professional presence across all channels. The agency will drive campaigns, PR, content, and community engagement — pairing strong technology with strong visibility.

## Motivation

Talos operates in a crowded market where innovation alone is not enough; projects must also be seen, understood, and trusted. Currently, much of the promotional effort is carried out by the same people leading development and strategy. While this has helped establish Talos’ early presence, it also spreads focus across multiple priorities. A dedicated marketing agency allows the core team to concentrate fully on building while ensuring that promotion and growth receive consistent, professional attention:
1. Developers remain focused on building.  
2. Talos gains consistent, professional promotion.  
3. Adoption accelerates through clearer communication and targeted campaigns.  

The guiding principle: strong technology must be paired with strong visibility.


## Specification

### Agency Responsibilities
1. Develop and execute a comprehensive marketing plan aligned with Talos’ roadmap.  
2. Manage official social channels and community engagement.  
3. Produce high-quality content (articles, graphics, videos, partnerships).  
4. Run targeted campaigns to attract users, stakers, and institutional interest.  
5. Provide monthly performance reports with KPIs.  

### Talos Team Responsibilities
1. Focus on development, innovation, and protocol security.  
2. Supply technical updates and context for accurate messaging.  
3. Oversee alignment between marketing and Talos’ mission.  

### Budget
- $4,000 – $10,000 monthly.  
- Funded directly from the Talos treasury.  


## Rationale

Hiring a marketing agency creates clear benefits:

- **Developer Focus**: Core team dedicates all time to building and innovating.  
- **Professional Expertise**: Agencies bring tools, networks, and experience Talos might lack internally.  
- **Consistent Growth**: Ongoing campaigns and PR strengthen presence and credibility.  
- **Efficiency**: Predictable monthly costs secure specialized talent for promotion.  

The balance of strong tech + strong visibility accelerates adoption, attracts capital, and positions Talos as a leader.


## Security Considerations

Although no direct technical risks are introduced, indirect risks must be managed:
- **Brand & Reputation Risk**: Miscommunication could damage credibility. Mitigation: core team approval for technical accuracy before publishing.  
- **Access Control**: If agency manages social/community channels, ensure restricted, revocable, role-based permissions.  
- **Confidential Information**: Protect sensitive updates via NDAs.  
- **Performance Risk**: Poor execution wastes treasury funds. Mitigation: define KPIs and conduct regular reviews.  

By separating technical systems from marketing operations and setting clear guidelines, no new attack surfaces are created.


## Implementation

**Agency Selection (Week 1-2):**  
- Collect proposals from qualified Web3/DeFi/AI marketing agencies.  
- Evaluate based on cost, past performance, and alignment with Talos’ mission.  
- Finalize contract terms including KPIs and deliverables.  
**Onboarding (Week 2-3):**  
- Provide brand guidelines, documentation, and messaging.  
- Grant limited access to communication channels.  
- Align on short-term (3-month) goals and long-term strategy.  
**Execution (Months 1–6):**  
- Launch campaigns across social, community, and PR.  
- Run targeted initiatives to grow awareness, adoption, and partnerships.  
- Deliver monthly KPI reports.  

**Review & Renewal (End of Month 6):**  
- Assess agency performance.  
- Decide on renewal, scope adjustment, or termination.
