## Abstract

This proposal suggests allocating treasury funds to buy back ≤1% of circulating Talos supply at current market conditions. Since Talos is trading near all-time lows, this represents a strategic opportunity to accumulate supply at discounted levels. The acquired tokens will be redirected into the bonding mechanism, where they can later be sold back to participants at higher valuations, generating sustainable protocol revenue.

## Motivation

Talos price is near ATL. It is optimal time to acquire supply at low cost.
Accumulated Talos can be injected into bonding reserves, strengthening protocol-owned liquidity and extending runway.
Future bonding sales recycle these tokens into protocol income, turning short-term buybacks into long-term yield.

## Specification

1.Treasury allocates funds to purchase less than or equal to 1% of Talos supply from the open market.
2.Acquired Talos is deposited into the bonding reserves.
3.Bonding mechanism executes sales gradually as demand increases, ensuring profitable turnover.

## Rationale

The rationale behind this proposal is based on the observation that Talos is currently trading near all-time lows, presenting an ideal window for acquisition at lower costs. By reorganizing treasury funds for this purpose, the protocol can not only bolster its assets but also create a mechanism for revenue generation through future bonding events.

## Security Considerations

1. A sudden large buy may cause price spikes; mitigation via TWAP (time-weighted average price) purchases or spread allocation over multiple blocks.‎
‎2.Ensure Talos transferred into bonding reserves interacts only with verified, audited contracts to avoid misallocation or lockup errors.

## Implementation

1.Treasury allocates funds less than or equivalent to 1% of Talos circulating supply at current market price.
2.Buyback is executed through a DEX (or designated liquidity venue) using time-weighted purchases to reduce slippage and market disruption.
3.All purchased Talos is deposited into the bonding reserve contract.
4.Bonding contracts are updated to recognize the new Talos inventory, making it available for future discounted bond sales.
5.The process is transparent, with buyback transactions verifiable on-chain.
