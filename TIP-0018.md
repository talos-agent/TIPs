## Abstract

This proposal recommends transitioning Talos governance to a delegate-based council model, introducing a structured, recurring election cycle every two months to ensure ongoing accountability, diversity of thought, and operational agility.

## Motivation

The current governance structure has shortcomings in flexibility, inclusiveness, and adaptability. Introducing a delegate council with transparent, time-bound elections offers a mechanism to balance short-term responsiveness with long-term vision, improving trust and effectiveness in protocol stewardship.

## Specification

Delegate Council Structure:
- The council will consist of **7 delegates**, elected via token-weighted **quadratic voting**.
- Delegates will serve for **2-month terms** (bimonthly election cycles).
- A quorum of **4/7** members will be required for proposal approval.
- Delegates must be re-elected each cycle; no permanent members.

Council Composition Considerations (Members/Quorum):

7/4:
Pros:
- Greater diversity of thought
- Less risk of centralization
- Stronger protection against groupthink
- More resilience if members become inactive

Cons:
- Slightly higher coordination overhead
- Potential slower decision-making
- Requires more voter participation

5/3:
Pros:
- Leaner, faster decision-making
- Easier to coordinate
- Lower voter engagement required

Cons:
- Higher risk of centralization
- Greater risk of groupthink
- Fewer checks and balances

Election Cycle Duration Considerations:

2 months:
Pros:
- Balance of agility and continuity
- Allows measurable progress
- Reduces fatigue while maintaining engagement
- Easier to rotate ineffective members

Cons:
- Still relatively short for long-term projects
- Moderate voting demand on community

Delegate Prerequisites:
- Must hold a minimum number of TALOS tokens (TBD).
- Must lock/stake their tokens for **at least 12 months** to align with long-term protocol goals.
- Must publicly declare any **conflicts of interest**, affiliations, or protocol investments.
- Prior to each election cycle, must provide a short rationale outlining their vision, approach, and commitment.

Token Holder Structure:
- Token holders vote for a delegate under ‘quadratic voting’ which is a way to normalize voting where large holders own a significant amount of token supply (referred to as Plutocracy risk). This also reduces voting apathy. 
- Under quadratic voting, waterfall method of delegate acceptance is applied in that 7 delegates with the most votes become the council.

This system will be implemented as a **trial** for the first election cycle (2 months). A formal TIP review will follow this period to evaluate effectiveness and recommend adjustments.

## Rationale

The proposed system is designed to enhance governance transparency, diversity of thought, and alignment between delegates and the protocol’s long-term vision. Through quadratic voting and staking requirements, it minimizes plutocracy, promoting informed participation with a long-term outlook.

This system will be implemented as a **trial** for the first election cycle (2 months). A formal TIP review will follow this period to evaluate effectiveness and recommend adjustments.

## Security Considerations

To be determined by the technical stakholders involved in the protocol.

## Implementation

Upon TIP approval:
- Set up frontend delegate election UI using tooling such as Snapshot or Tally.
- Publish delegate applications
- Enable quadratic voting for token holders
- Initiate first election cycle
- Monitor and assess outcome post 2-month term
