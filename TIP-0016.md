## Abstract

Dune Analytics dashboards provide insightful real-time data on fundamental performance metrics such as Daily Active Users (DAUs) and Total Value Locked (TVL), enabling comparisons of protocols and benchmarking against competitors, ultimately improving decision-making for investors, users and Protocol developers. Providing Talos with a Dune Analytics API integration can lead to Talos learning to create its own dashboards.

## Motivation

The integration of Dune Analytics dashboards will empower Talos to harness powerful, real-time data on critical performance metrics such as Daily Active Users (DAUs) and Total Value Locked (TVL). This capability will not only enhance Talos's insight into its own protocol performance but also allow it to benchmark against competitors effectively. By enabling Talos to create customized dashboards, it can facilitate improved decision-making, drive competitive analysis, and adapt swiftly within the dynamic cryptocurrency and digital asset landscape.

## Specification

The proposal entails accessing the Dune Analytics API and integrating with Talos to provide it with the capabilities to learn and create its own dashboards. Further information regarding the API is linked within the Dune Analytics documentation (https://docs.dune.com/api-reference/overview/introduction)

## Rationale

Integrating Dune Analytics dashboards into Talos will provide users with immediate access to comparative analytics, empowering more informed strategic decisions. By Talos learning how to create Dune Analytics dashboards, this can also be outsourced as a revenue-generating service to provide Developers with the ability to efficiently develop dashboards for their respective protocols.

## Security Considerations

When integrating the Dune Analytics API into Talos, it is crucial to assess potential security risks including, but not limited to, unauthorized access to sensitive data and API abuse. Proper authentication and authorization mechanisms must be implemented to ensure that only authorized personnel can access and utilize the API. Additionally, the integration should adhere to best practices for data encryption both in transit and at rest. Regular audits and monitoring of API usage can help detect any anomalous behavior, allowing for timely responses to potential breaches. Lastly, a clear policy regarding data privacy and compliance with relevant regulations must be established to protect user information and maintain trust within the community.

## Implementation

1. **Define Use Cases**: Identify specific use cases for Dune Analytics dashboards that Talos will focus on (e.g., DAUs, TVL).
   
2. **API Key Access**: 
   - Request and secure an API key from Dune Analytics.
   - Ensure that proper authentication is in place.

3. **Integrate API Logic**: Implement logic within Talos to interact with the Dune Analytics API, focusing on fetching metrics needed for dashboard creation.

4. **Testing**: 
   - Conduct tests to verify API connectivity and data accuracy.
   - Ensure that the logic fetching data operates correctly and efficiently.

5. **Build Dashboard Mockups**: Create initial mockups for dashboards based on the identified use cases.

6. **Stakeholder Feedback**: Present the mockups to stakeholders for input and final adjustments before full deployment.

7. **Deployment**: Once finalized, deploy the new dashboard feature in the production environment.

8. **Monitor & Maintain**: Keep track of API usage and dashboard performance, making necessary updates and improvements.
