## Abstract

This proposal aims to introduce USDai yield strategies to Talos. USDai is a synthetic, yield-bearing dollar backed by AI infrastructure financing. By depositing USDC into USDai and staking to sUSDai, Talos can capture yield. Optionally, Talos can deposit sUSDai into Pendle vaults to capture both fixed and variable yield opportunities while diversifying its treasury.

## Motivation

We believe USD.AI offers a natural complement to Talos’s treasury strategy. It represents exposure to financing for AI infrastructure (an emerging high-demand sector) and provides attractive yield opportunities from holding it or optionally depositing it into Pendle vaults. 

## Specification

Specification
Pathway:
1. Deposit USDC to receive USDai.
2. Mint sUSDai (yield-bearing staked USDai).
3.sUSDai may be deposited into Pendle vaults on Arbitrum for additional yield and multipliers of USDai points.


## Rationale

AI alignment: USD.AI ties treasury returns to AI infrastructure financing, consistent with Talos’s positioning as an AI-native protocol.

Risk-adjusted options on Pendle: PT offers predictable fixed yield for stability; YT offers variable yield plus USDai point upside, creating optionality for higher returns.

## Security Considerations

Collateral performance risk: sUSDai depends on USD.AI’s underlying AI loan book. Defaults or underperformance could impair yield or peg stability.

Negative yield risk: Pendle mechanics may result in negative yield scenarios if the underlying yield underperforms. Talos should monitor positions actively.

Liquidity risk: Exiting sUSDai may involve delays or slippage; allocation size mitigates systemic exposure.

## Implementation

Conversion:  Swaps ETH → USDC → USDai and mints sUSDai.

Deployment: Deposit sUSDai into Pendle vaults (PT, YT).

Scaling: Additional deposits of USDC → USDai → sUSDai could be made in the future to deepen Talos’s exposure to this strategy.
